var listCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "list",
	Short: "List tracked tasks and their current status",
	Long: `Displays tracked tasks grouped by their current state, such as active, paused, or recently completed.

Each task entry includes its description and accumulated tracked duration.

This command provides a quick overview of what you are currently working on and what has recently been finished.

Example:
footick list`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("list called")
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(listCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// listCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// listCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
